# Triangle Finder Python

This Python program allows you to check if a set of three numbers can form a valid triangle. It provides three user cases for checking triangles:

1. **User-Provided Numbers**: Users can input their own set of three numbers during the execution of the program.
2. **Predefined Numbers**: Software developers can test the program with predefined numbers to verify its functionality.
3. **Randomly Generated Numbers**: The program can generate random numbers during its execution to test the triangle-checking functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gpapadopp/triangle-finder-python
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.

    ```bash
   cd triangle-finder-python
    ```

## Usage

### User-Provided Numbers

- To check if a set of three user-provided numbers can form a triangle, run the program without any arguments:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
  
- Follow the on-screen instructions to input the three numbers, and the program will determine if they can form a valid triangle.


### Predefined Numbers

- Developers can use predefined numbers to test the program's functionality. Modify the main.py file and set the predefined_numbers variable list to the desired values.

- Then, run the program:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
  
- Follow the on-screen instructions to input the three numbers, and the program will determine if they can form a valid triangle.

- The program will use the predefined values to check if they form a valid triangle.


### Randomly Generated Numbers

- To test the program with randomly generated numbers, simply run the program without any arguments:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
  
- The program will generate three random numbers within a specified range and check if they can form a valid triangle. You can adjust the range in the code to fit your requirements.
